MVC 

MVC stands for model view controller. which is commonly used in software development. I



In previous years User need to know programming or  need the help of programmer to do calculations or save data in machines. In order to update user’s using experience, scientists developed MVC so that user wouldn’t need programmer to do calculations or save data on computers.

Model is the M in MVC, which define the data structure part of the program. The model encapsulate the storage and validation concerns. 

View get data from model(directly or indirectly) and display to user through GUI for user to use which is very friendly forusers nowadays. It defines some methods for controller to use but usually does not have the abilities modify the data inside the model. Typically, the view send request though event handler 


Controller
The role of the controller is passing information between view and model. It acts as a programmer between user and data which usually contains the logic part of the program In a separately program. The controller has access to part of the methods that is defined in view and does calculations and convert to the structure where can be saved in model, on other hands, the controller is able to read data from model through the data structure defined in model and pass it to the view. Another function of controller is it can check the feedback() of view and model and decide to wait or start next task.
